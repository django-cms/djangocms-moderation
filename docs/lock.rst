Moderation Review Lock
================================================
As soon as a :ref:`moderation_collection` status becomes in review then its drafts are automatically locked, in the sense that their content can no longer be edited (not at all, not by anyone, not even the collection author). Also once a collection is in Review then content versions cannot be added to the collection. This means that once you’ve clicked “Submit for review”: 
 * Collection Lock: New drafts cannot be added to the :ref:`moderation_collection`
 * Version Lock: Drafts in the :ref:`moderation_collection` cannot be edited unless rejected
   
Once a version is published the Moderation Version Lock is removed automatically.
